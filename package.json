  "description":
    "A VS Code theme for the night owls out there. Works well in the daytime, too, but this theme is fine-tuned for those of us who like to code late into the night. Color choices have taken into consideration what is accessible to people with colorblindness and in low-light circumstances. Decisions were also based on meaningful contrast for reading comprehension and for optimal razzle dazzle. âœ¨",
